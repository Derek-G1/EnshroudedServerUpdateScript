# EnshroudedServerUpdateScript
This is a batch or .bat script that will update you enshrouded server automatically

I wrote a .bat script that will update your server automatically so we dont have to do it manually

Here's what it does:
 
Checks to see if the enshrouded server is running, if it is kill the script if it's not it continues with the script and will update your sever then start it

This was done on a server that was installed with SteamCMD

1.Your server must be off when running this or it will not work

2.Download the update_server.bat file  

3.copy file to the the same folder as the server

4.set the path to your steamcmd

set "steamcmd_path=C:\Users\User\SteamCMD\steamcmd.exe"

5.Change the path to your server folder
example: set "server_dir=C:\Users\User\SteamCMD\steamapps\common\enshrouded-server"

6.double click the .bat file and it should work
